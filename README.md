            pip install pygame

            https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted

    2. Run the game by typing "python3 sudoku.py" or "python sudoku.py" in the terminal, or by
       opening it and running via an IDE.

    3. A pygame window will open up that allows you to play the game. To navigate the sudoku grid,
       use your arrow keys ('Up' key to move up, 'Down' key to move down, 'Left' key to move left, and
       'Right' key to move right. When you want to enter a number into an empty cell, simply press that number
       on your keyboard. Numbers that you have entered are colored blue, numbers that were present originally are colored black.
       To erase a blue number, simply select its cell and then press 'escape'.

       To exit a game, simply press 'X' in the top right corner of the screen.
       To restart, close the game and run the program again.
